      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>
        The Arduino IDE and SparkFun Apollo3 board package were installed and updated on my local machine.
        The SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano was selected as the active board and successfully connected via USB.
        I verified correct operation using example sketches and confirmed that all inputs operate at 3.3 V logic.

      <p>
        I combined microphone readout with serial output to create a simplified electronic tuner.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In this lab, I set up the Arduino IDE and learned how to use the Artemis Nano board.
        I tested basic functions such as blinking an LED, using the serial monitor, and reading
        data from the temperature sensor and microphone. This lab helped me understand the board
        and prepared me for later labs involving sensing and communication.

    <h2 id="lab1b">Lab 1B</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of Lab 1B is to establish communication between computer and the Artemis board through the Bluetooth stack.

    </div>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <h4>Setup</h4>
      <p>
        I first set up the laptop and the Artemis Nano so they could reliably communicate over BLE.
        On the laptop, I created a Python environment for BLE and installed the required packages from the lab codebase.
        On the Artemis side, I uploaded the provided <code>ble_arduino.ino</code> sketch, which initializes BLE, defines the GATT service/characteristics,
        and starts advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        After uploading, the Artemis printed its BLE MAC address in the Serial Monitor. This confirmed that BLE initialized correctly and the board was advertising.
      </p>
      <img class="img-small" src="macaddress.png" alt="Serial monitor showing Artemis BLE MAC address">
      <p class="muted">Serial Monitor output confirming BLE advertising and the Artemis MAC address.</p>

      <div style="margin-top: 28px;"></div>
      <h4>Configuration</h4>
      <p>
        To make sure my Python client connects to the correct board and the correct BLE interface, I updated <code>connection.yaml</code>.
        This file stores the Artemis MAC address, the BLE service UUID, and the UUIDs for each characteristic.
      </p>
      <p>
        I generated a unique BLE service UUID in Python using <code>uuid4()</code> and used the same UUID in both the Arduino sketch and <code>connection.yaml</code>.
      </p>
      <img class="img-small" src="jp.png" alt="uuid4() used to generate a BLE service UUID">
      <p class="muted">Generating a unique BLE service UUID in Python.</p>

      <p>
        The service exposes these characteristics, which define how data moves between the laptop and the Artemis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>TX_CMD_STRING</code>: laptop → Artemis (write). Used to send command strings from Python.</li>
        <li><code>RX_STRING</code>: Artemis → laptop (notify/read). Used to send string replies and streamed data.</li>
        <li><code>RX_FLOAT</code>: Artemis → laptop (notify/read). Reserved for numeric data (used in later/extended tasks).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The same service UUID and characteristic UUIDs are defined in the Arduino sketch so the Artemis advertises the expected BLE interface.
      </p>
      <img class="img-small" src="inosketch.png" alt="Arduino sketch showing BLE service and characteristic UUID definitions">
      <p class="muted">Arduino sketch: service UUID and characteristic UUID definitions.</p>

      <p>
        Finally, I copied the MAC address, service UUID, and characteristic UUIDs into <code>connection.yaml</code> so the Python client connects to the correct device and characteristics.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">connection.yaml: Artemis MAC address, service UUID, and characteristic UUIDs.</p>

      <div style="margin-top: 28px;"></div>

      <h4>Code Base</h4>
      <p>
        The provided BLE codebase has two parts: an Arduino program on the Artemis (BLE peripheral) and a Python client on the laptop (BLE central).
        The Python client connects using the MAC address and service UUID, then sends commands by writing to <code>TX_CMD_STRING</code>.
        On the Artemis, the sketch reads the received command, parses it, and runs the corresponding handler.
      </p>

      <p>
        After executing a command, the Artemis returns results to the laptop using BLE notifications (typically through <code>RX_STRING</code>).
        In Python, a notification handler can be registered to receive these messages asynchronously, which is especially useful for streaming data and measuring data rate.
      </p>
