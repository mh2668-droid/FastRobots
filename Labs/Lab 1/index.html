      <p>
        The purpose of Lab 1A is to set up and become familiar with the Arduino IDE and the Artemis board.

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Setup</h3>
      <p>
        The Arduino IDE and SparkFun Apollo3 board package were installed and updated on my local machine.
        The SparkFun RedBoard Artemis Nano was selected as the active board and successfully connected via USB.
        I verified correct operation using example sketches and confirmed that all inputs operate at 3.3 V logic.

      <h3>Tasks</h3>

      <h4>Task 1: Blink</h4>
      <p>
        A basic blink sketch was uploaded to verify correct board configuration and GPIO operation.

      <h4>Task 2: Serial Communication</h4>
      <p>
        Serial communication was tested using the Arduino Serial Monitor and the board successfully
        transmitted formatted messages at the specified baud rate.

      <h4>Task 3: Temperature Sensor</h4>
      <p>
        The onboard temperature sensor was read using analog input. Measured values changed
        in response to touch and ambient conditions as shown in the video.

      <h4>Task 4: Microphone</h4>
      <p>
        The microphone was used to detect sound intensity and dominant frequency components, 
        Changes in the output were observed when I change the frequency.

      <h4>Task 5: Electric Tuning</h4>
      <p>
        I combined microphone readout with serial output to create a simplified electronic tuner.
        The program detected and reported different dominant frequencies in real time.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In this lab, I set up the Arduino IDE and learned how to use the Artemis Nano board.
        I tested basic functions such as blinking an LED, using the serial monitor, and reading
        data from the temperature sensor and microphone. This lab helped me understand the board
        and prepared me for later labs involving sensing and communication.

    <div class="card">

        The purpose of Lab 1B is to establish communication between computer and the Artemis board through the Bluetooth stack.

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <h4>BLE Setup</h4>
      <p>
        I set up a Python environment for BLE communication and installed the required packages (including <code>bleak</code>).
        On the Artemis side, I uploaded the provided <code>ble_arduino.ino</code> sketch and confirmed the board was advertising by printing its BLE MAC address in the Serial Monitor.
      </p>
      <img src="macaddress.png" alt="Serial monitor showing Artemis BLE MAC address">
      <p class="muted">Serial Monitor output confirming BLE advertising and the Artemis MAC address.</p>

      <h4>Configuration</h4>
      <p>
        To connect the Python client to my specific Artemis board, I updated <code>connection.yaml</code> with my Artemis MAC address
        (<code>artemis_address</code>) and a unique BLE service UUID (<code>ble_service</code>). I generated the UUID in Python using <code>uuid4()</code>
        and set the same service UUID in the Arduino sketch so both sides matched.
      </p>

      <p>
        The BLE service exposes several characteristics that define how data is sent between the laptop and the Artemis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>TX_CMD_STRING</code>: used by the laptop to send command strings to the Artemis (e.g., <code>ECHO</code>, <code>GET_TIME_MILLIS</code>)</li>
        <li><code>RX_STRING</code>: used by the Artemis to send string responses back to the laptop via notifications</li>
        <li><code>RX_FLOAT</code>: defined for sending numeric data (used in later or extended tasks)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> I generated a unique BLE service UUID (using <code>uuid4()</code>) and updated the Arduino sketch so the Artemis advertises my custom service and characteristics.
      </p>

      <img src="inosketch.png" alt="Arduino sketch showing BLE service and characteristic UUID definitions">
      <p class="muted">Arduino sketch: service UUID and characteristic UUID definitions.</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> I copied the same service UUID and characteristic UUIDs into <code>connection.yaml</code> so the Python client connects to the correct BLE service on my Artemis board.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">connection.yaml: Artemis MAC address, service UUID, and characteristic UUIDs.</p>


      <h4>Code Base</h4>
      <p>
        The provided BLE codebase has two parts: an Arduino program on the Artemis (BLE peripheral) and a Python client on the laptop (BLE central).
        The Python client connects using the MAC address and service UUID, then sends commands by writing to <code>TX_CMD_STRING</code>.
        On the Artemis, the sketch reads the received command, parses it, and runs the corresponding handler.
      </p>

      <p>
        After executing a command, the Artemis returns results to the laptop using BLE notifications (typically through <code>RX_STRING</code>).
        In Python, a notification handler can be registered to receive these messages asynchronously, which is especially useful for streaming data and measuring data rate.
      </p>
